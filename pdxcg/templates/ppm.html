        <p> Join us on Monday evenings at 6 pm for Monday Python Flying Circus! This free
          Meetup is open to programmers of all levels. (Seriously, this is a beginner-friendly
          group. And for experienced developers, it’s a great chance to mentor and connect
          with other developers.) </p>
        <p> So bring your laptop and any projects you’re working on, and get ready to talk
          Python, Django, JavaScript, jQuery, SQL, CSS ad HTML. </p>
        <p> RSVP on our <a href="http://www.meetup.com/pdxpython/events/">Meetup page</a> to let us know you’re coming and connect with other
          members of our group! </p>
