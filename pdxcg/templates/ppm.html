Join us on Monday evenings at 6 pm for Monday Python Flying Circus! This free 
Meetup is open to programmers of all levels. (Seriously, this is a beginner-friendly 
group. And for experienced developers, it’s a great chance to mentor and connect 
with other developers.) </p>

<p>
So bring your laptop and any projects you’re working on, and get ready to talk 
Python, Django, JavaScript, jQuery, SQL, CSS ad HTML. </p>
