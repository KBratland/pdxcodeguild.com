        <p>Grant’s experience includes technical training and consulting.  If he were a super hero, he would be called Super SQL Person, or something like that. His super powers would be DB development, DB administration, ETL, and SQL Server business intelligence. His other powers include Juniper, networking (think security), server infrastructure like high availibility, and even some Active Directory. His mission: turn data into meaningful insight and flexible backends!</p>

<p>Other things that he does well are Python and Django web development. The backend is his domain. He also enjoys mathematics. Recently he’s been taking on some graph theory and learning graph databases like Neo4j and its awesome query language Cypher. Basically, if he’s not done it before, and he can learn it, he’s right in his element.</p>

At the age of 12 he taught himself HTML and started on the long road of web development addiction.</p>
