                <p>1. Print “Hello World”<br>
                    2. Create a list called fruit that has Apples, Oranges and Bananas as values.<br>

                    4. Change Oranges to Grapes using the numeric list index.<br>
                    5. Create a loop that prints out each item in the fruit list.<br>
                    6. Create a dictionary called people that has another dictionary for each Bob (age 22), Carol (age

                    7. Create a function that takes two numbers (a and b) and prints the total value when they are
                    added.<br>
                    8. Call your function with 5 and 5, 10 and 15 and 3 and 6.<br>
                    9. Create a function that takes user input of an integer and loops through printing that number plus
                    5 until it reaches 1000.<br>
                    10. Write a program that prints the integers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print "Fizz"
                    instead of the number, and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples
                    of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".<br>
                    11. Create a class called customer that takes the customer name as a variable and is initialized

                    age, location of Washington and a credit score of 718.<br>
                    12. Create an object from your customer class with the name of Jessie.<br>
                    13. Print the name value of your object.<br>
                    14. Print the location of your object.<br>
                    15. Print the credit score of your object.<br>
